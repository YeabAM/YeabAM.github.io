    "title": "Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) in Understanding Cancer Dynamics",
    "period": "Oct 2025 - Present",
    "description": "This research explores the application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to model the evolution of cancer cell populations as part of the EDISS Master's program. By integrating Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT), we simulate how different cell types compete and adapt within a tumor microenvironment. We are currently utilizing established dynamical systems like Lotka-Volterra equations as a baseline before transitioning to high-dimensional real-world datasets.",
    "relevance": "Standard deep learning models often lack the symbolic interpretability required for clinical trust. KANs offer a more transparent architecture that, when combined with EGT, allows us to predict therapeutic resistance. This is vital for shifting from static, one-size-fits-all treatments to personalized, dynamic oncology that adjusts to the tumor's evolutionary state."
